# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

We are a pure meritocracy and take contributions from anybody who can show that the data they are adding or changing is accurate via original source documents.

No matter how rude they are.  We are tough enough to deal with it.

I, [Chris Downey](https://chrisdowney.bio), believe that most Codes of Conduct, which are derived from [this group-think statement](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), are annoying, bossy, wimpy ("if you are mean, we will kick you out!") virtue-signaling that assumes a left-leaning bias is the best way to think and talk.  

No thank you.

We can jettison all the legalistic Woke-talk - and just apply the beautiful golden rule [from all major religions](https://www.nrm.org/2018/03/golden-rule-common-religions/) as our ideal.

> I’d been reading up on comparative religion. 
> The thing is that all major religions have the Golden Rule in Common. 
> ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’ 
> Not always the same words but the same meaning.

> Norman Rockwell

Vaccine-risk is deadly serious.  We need smart, tough people to build upon our work and/or prove it wrong so that it continually improves.
